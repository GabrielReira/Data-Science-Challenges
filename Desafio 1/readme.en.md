You are part of the Analytics team of a large clothing brand with over 25 stores spread across shopping malls throughout Brazil.

Every week you need to send the management an updated ranking of the 25 stores containing 3 pieces of information:

- Revenue of each store;
- Quantity of products sold from each store;
- Average ticket of products from each store.

In addition, each store has 1 manager who needs to receive a summary of their store's information. Therefore, each manager should receive in their email:

- Revenue of their store;
- Quantity of products sold from their store;
- Average ticket of products from their store.

This report is always sent as a summary of all the data available for the year.
