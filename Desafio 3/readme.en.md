You have been chosen for the Airbnb Rio Project, a Property Price Prediction Tool for ordinary people.

On Airbnb, anyone who has a room or any type of property (apartment, house, chalet, inn, etc.) can offer their property to be rented on a daily basis.

You create your host profile (the person who makes a property available for daily rental) and create the listing for your property.

In this listing, the host must describe the characteristics of the property as completely as possible, in order to help renters/travelers choose the best property for them (and to make their listing more attractive).

There are dozens of possible customizations in your listing, from minimum daily rate, price, number of rooms, to cancellation policies, extra fees for additional guests, identity verification requirements for the renter, etc.

Your goal is to build a price prediction model that allows an ordinary person who owns a property to know how much they should charge for the daily rate of their property. Or, for the average renter, given the property they are looking for, to help them know if that property is priced attractively (below the average for properties with the same characteristics) or not.

The only information you have is some databases that contain the prices of the properties obtained and their respective characteristics each month. The databases range from April 2018 to May 2020, with the exception of June 2018, which does not have a database.
