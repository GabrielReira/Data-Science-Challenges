You work for a company that sells high-value-added services, and your clients have a 30-day deadline to make their payments.

However, as in almost every company, clients do not always pay the amount on the agreed date or do not always settle the full amount. Therefore, these clients are considered delinquent.

The finance team responsible for tracking the amounts owed by each client has noticed that the delinquency rates have been increasing in recent months.

Every day, a new spreadsheet is generated with the clients who have become delinquent that day, and the customer service team needs to contact each delinquent client via email to send them the invoice with the bill.

The problem is that this process is done manually through the PagSeguro website and is very repetitive. And anything repetitive can be automated.

Therefore, it is up to you to automate this process, keeping in mind that the payments are made through PagSeguro, and the delinquent individuals are in an Excel spreadsheet.
